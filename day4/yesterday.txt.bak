Seems the love I've ever known
看来，过去我所知道的爱情

Has always been the most destructive kind
似乎总是最具有毁灭性的那种
Guess that's why now
或许，那就是为什么
I feel so old before my time
如今我感觉如此的未老先衰
Yesterday, when I was young,
昨日，当我轻狂年少
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue,
生命的滋味甜美有如我舌尖上的雨水
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
我戏弄著生命，彷佛它只是一场愚蠢的游戏
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
就好像夜晚的微风逗弄著一盏烛火那样
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned,
成千个我所做过的梦，还有那些我所计画的大业
I always built, alas, on weak and shifting sand,
我总是建筑在，唉，松软的流沙上
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day,
我夜夜笙歌，躲避著白昼赤裸的ta
And only now I see how the years ran away
直到现在，我才惊觉岁月已经如何的消逝
